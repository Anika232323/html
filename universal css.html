<h2>Irish recipe</h2>
<p>Crispy potatoes, onions, and shredded corn beef make for a wonderfully satisfying breakfast. Cutting up and frying the corned beef fat by itself before adding the other ingredients allows the corned beef flavor to permeate every element of the hash, making each deeply savory.</p>
