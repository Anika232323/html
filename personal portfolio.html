My name is Anika, and I am currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at SDNB Vaishnav College. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages, including Python, HTML, and CSS. Python has been a particular area of interest for me due to its versatility and extensive applications in AI and machine learning. I have also gained experience with web development technologies such as HTML and CSS, which have allowed me to build interactive and responsive websites. Being at the intersection of computer science and AI, I am eager to expand my knowledge in machine learning, data science, and AI algorithms, and I aim to apply these skills in real-world projects. Alongside my coursework, I enjoy participating in coding</p>
