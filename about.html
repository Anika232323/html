    <p>1. <strong>BSc CS with AI Students</strong><br>
    - BSc Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence is a specialized undergraduate program that combines traditional computer science studies with the emerging field of AI.<br>
    - First-year students are likely in the early stages of their academic journey, learning foundational concepts of computer science, programming, mathematics, and basic principles of AI, such as machine learning, neural networks, and data science.</p>
    
    <p>2. <strong>NEURAL NEXUS</strong><br>
    <strong>Event Overview:</strong><br>
    Format: A quiz competition between two players.<br>
    Topic Focus: The quiz will test participants on a variety of topics related to computer systems, programming languages, and potentially other areas within computer science and artificial intelligence.<br>
    Objective: Participants will compete by answering questions, with the goal being to score the most points and demonstrate their knowledge of tech-related subjects.<br>
    Outcome:<br>
    Winner: The player who answers the most questions correctly and scores the highest will be crowned the winner.<br>
    Runner-up: The second-best player, who performs well but doesn’t quite win, will be named the runner-up.<br>
    Rewards: Both the winner and the runner-up will receive cash prizes as incentives for their performance.<br>
    Skills Tested:<br>
    - General knowledge of computer science concepts such as algorithms, hardware, software, etc.<br>
    - Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++) and their uses.<br>
    - Understanding of AI basics (like machine learning, neural networks, etc.).</p>
    
    <p>3. <strong>ADZAP</strong><br>
    <strong>Event Overview:</strong><br>
    Format: A group event, where each team consists of 4 to 5 members.<br>
    Task: Teams will be required to create and present an advertisement for a product, service, or idea on the spot.<br>
    The twist is that the team will not have prior preparation time for the advertisement, so they’ll need to think creatively and spontaneously.<br>
    Objective: The goal is to craft an engaging and persuasive ad that captures attention and sells the idea effectively to the judges or audience.<br>
    Outcome:<br>
    Winner: The team whose advertisement is the most creative, persuasive, and entertaining will win the competition.<br>
    Runner-up: The team that comes close in creativity and presentation but doesn’t quite take the top spot.<br>
    Rewards: Cash prizes will be awarded to both the winning and runner-up teams.<br>
    Skills Tested:<br>
    - Creativity in designing a unique and memorable advertisement.<br>
    - Communication and persuasion skills to effectively convey the message.<br>
    - Teamwork and collaboration as the group needs to work together to develop and present the ad.<br>
    - Impromptu thinking, as the challenge is to create an advertisement without prior preparation.</p>
    
    <p>4. <strong>HACKVERSE</strong><br>
    <strong>Event Overview:</strong><br>
    Format: An individual event, meaning each participant competes alone.<br>
    Task: Participants will be given a set of debugging tasks. These tasks could involve identifying and fixing bugs or errors in code snippets, software systems, or other types of programming problems.<br>
    Rounds: There are two rounds in the event:<br>
    Round 1: Participants will be given a set of problems to debug and must find and fix the issues within a specific time frame.<br>
    Round 2: A more advanced or difficult set of debugging tasks may be introduced, testing the participants’ deeper problem-solving skills and technical knowledge.<br>
    Outcome:<br>
    Winner: The participant who performs the best in both rounds, fixing the most bugs correctly, will be the winner.<br>
    Runner-up: The second-best performer, who excels but doesn’t win, will take the runner-up spot.<br>
    Rewards: The winners (both the winner and the runner-up) will receive cash prizes.<br>
    Skills Tested:<br>
    - Debugging skills: The core focus is on spotting errors in code and fixing them.<br>
    - Problem-solving ability: Participants need to think critically and logically to identify the issues and determine the best way to resolve them.<br>
    - Attention to detail: Debugging often requires a keen eye for the smallest issues in code.<br>
    - Programming proficiency: A deep understanding of programming languages and common coding errors will be necessary.</p>
    
    <p>5. <strong>TECH BATTLE</strong><br>
    <strong>Event Overview:</strong><br>
    Format: An individual event, meaning each participant competes solo.<br>
    Task: Participants will be given a set of programming challenges to solve using any programming language they are comfortable with.<br>
    Rounds: The event consists of two rounds:<br>
    Round 1: A set of basic to intermediate programming problems that test participants’ problem-solving skills and coding ability.<br>
    Round 2: More advanced problems or potentially timed challenges that require deeper technical knowledge and quicker thinking.<br>
    Outcome:<br>
    Winner: The participant who successfully solves the most problems in the least amount of time will be crowned the winner.<br>
    Runner-up: The second-best performer who shows strong skills but doesn’t quite make it to first place will be the runner-up.<br>
    Rewards: Both the winner and runner-up will receive cash prizes for their achievements.<br>
    Skills Tested:<br>
    - Programming proficiency: Participants will need to be well-versed in one or more programming languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java, etc.).<br>
    - Problem-solving skills: This event is all about applying logical thinking and algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently.<br>
    - Time management: Given that this event may involve solving multiple problems under a time constraint, managing time effectively is key.<br>
    - Algorithm design and optimization: The challenges could require participants to design algorithms that are not just correct, but also efficient.</p>
    
    <p>6. <strong>FacePrep Campus</strong><br>
    - Through FacePrep Campus, we were able to conduct this event.<br>
    - Thanking FacePrep.</p>
    
    <p>7. <strong>Overall Goal</strong><br>
    - This event could aim to provide a learning experience, allowing first-year students to build their skills, network with peers and professionals, and understand the practical applications of what they’re learning in the classroom.<br>
    - It could also foster teamwork, leadership, and creativity among students as they organize or participate in various aspects of the event.</p>
